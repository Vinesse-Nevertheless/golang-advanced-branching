# Build a Vehicle Rating System in Go
In this project, you'll be using Go to build a console application that will gather feedback from a JSON file and generate a rating of vehicles. Finally, we will map each rating as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Setup
Set up your local environment for this project. We'll walk you through everything you need to know to set up your local instance, and to access the code you'll be using for this project.

## Defining interface, structs, and variables
By the end of this module, you'll have defined one interface, several structs and variables to help us create vehicle feedback application

## Calculate and generate vehicle ratings
By the end of this module, we have created a function to calculate the ratings from the feedback.json file for all the vehicles Models

## Show vehicle rating
In this last module, we will print the ratings for the vehicles in the inventory

In order to verify that everything is setup correctly, navigate to the project's root folder and run the following command:

        go test -v ./module1 ./module2 ./module3

This command should display a list of failing tests. We'll be making each one of these failing tests pass once we start coding our project.

## Previewing Your Work
To run the code, once all modules have been completed, use the following command:

       go run ./vehicle.go
